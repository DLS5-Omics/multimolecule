# RibonanzaNet

Pre-trained model on RNA chemical mapping for modeling RNA structure and other properties.

## Disclaimer

This is an UNOFFICIAL implementation of the [Ribonanza: deep learning of RNA structure through dual crowdsourcing](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.24.581671) by Shujun He, Rui Huang, et al.

The OFFICIAL repository of RibonanzaNet is at [Shujun-He/RibonanzaNet](https://github.com/Shujun-He/RibonanzaNet).

> [!WARNING]
> The MultiMolecule team is aware of a potential risk in reproducing the results of RibonanzaNet.
>
> The original implementation of RibonanzaNet does not prepend `<cls>` and append `<eos>` tokens to the input sequence.
> This should not affect the performance of the model in most cases, but it can lead to unexpected behavior in some cases.
>
> Please set `bos_token=None, cls_token=None, eos_token = None` in the tokenizer and set `bos_token_id=None, cls_token_id=None, eos_token_id=None` in the model configuration if you want the exact behavior of the original implementation.

> [!WARNING]
> The MultiMolecule team is aware of a potential risk in reproducing the results of RibonanzaNet.
>
> The original implementation of RibonanzaNet applied `dropout-residual-norm` path twice to the output of the Self-Attention layer.
>
> By default, the MultiMolecule follows the original implementation.
>
> You can set `fix_attention_norm=True` in the model configuration to apply the `dropout-residual-norm` path once.

## Model Details

RibonanzaNet is a [bert](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased)-style model.
RibonanzaNet follows the modification from the [RNAdegformer](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/1/bbac581/6986359) where it introduces a 1D convolution with residual connection at the beginning of each encoder layer.
Different from RNAdegformer, RibonanzaNet does not apply deconvolution at the end of the encoder layers, and updates the pairwise representation through outer product mean and triangular update.

RibonanzaNet is pre-trained on a large corpus of RNA sequences with chemical mapping (2A3 and DMS) measurements.
Please refer to the [Training Details](#training-details) section for more information on the training process.

```

## Training Details

RibonanzaNet used chemical mapping data as the training objective. The model takes an RNA sequence as input and predicts the chemical reactivity of each nucleotide.

### Training Data

The RibonanzaNet model was trained on the Ribonanza dataset. Ribonanza is a dataset of chemical mapping measurements on two million diverse RNA sequences. The data was collected from the crowdsourced initiative Eterna, as well as expert databases such as [Rfam](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multimolecule/rfam), the PDB archive, Pseudobase, and the RNA Mapping Database.

### Training Procedure

RibonanzaNet was trained using a three-stage process:

#### Initial Training

The initial model was trained using sequences that had either or both 2A3/DMS profiles with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 1.0. This dataset comprised 214,831 training sequences.

#### Pre-training

1. Noisy Training Data:
   The model was first pre-trained on the data with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 1.0 using predictions from top 3 Kaggle models as pseudo-labels. This dataset comprised 563,796 sequences.
2. Experimental Determined Data:
   The model was then further trained for 10 epochs using only the true labels of sequences with high SNR (either 2A3 or DMS profiles).

#### Final Training

1. Noisy Training Data:
   The model was first pre-trained on all training and testing data using predictions from top 3 Kaggle models as pseudo-labels. This dataset comprised 1,907,619 sequences.
2. Experimental Determined Data:
   The model was then further annelaed on the true training labels.

The model was trained on 10 NVIDIA L40S GPUs with 48GiB memories.

Sequence flip augmentation was applied to the training data.

Ribonanza measurements enabled solicitation, training, and prospective evaluation of diverse deep neural networks through a Kaggle challenge, followed by distillation into a single, self-contained model called RibonanzaNet. When fine tuned on auxiliary datasets, RibonanzaNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling experimental sequence dropout, RNA hydrolytic degradation, and RNA secondary structure, with implications for modeling RNA tertiary structure.Competing Interest StatementStanford University is filing patent applications based on concepts described in this paper.
