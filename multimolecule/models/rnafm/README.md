# RNA-FM

Pre-trained model on non-coding RNA using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.

## Disclaimer

This is the UNOFFICIAL implementation of the [Interpretable RNA Foundation Model from Unannotated Data for Highly Accurate RNA Structure and Function Predictions](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.06.503062) by Jiayang Chen, Zhihang Hue, Siqi Sun, et al.

The OFFICIAL repository of RNA-FM is at [ml4bio/RNA-FM](https://github.com/ml4bio/RNA-FM).

**The team releasing RNA-FM did not write this model card for this model so this model card has been written by the MultiMolecule team.**

## Model Details

RNA-FM is a [bert](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased)-style model pre-trained on a large corpus of non-coding RNA sequences in a self-supervised fashion. This means that the model was trained on the raw nucleotides of RNA sequences only, with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. Please refer to the [Training Details][#training-details] section for more information on the training process.
