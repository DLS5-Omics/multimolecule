class SpliceBertConfig(PreTrainedConfig):
    r"""
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a
    [`SpliceBertModel`][multimolecule.models.SpliceBertModel]. It is used to instantiate a SpliceBert model according
    to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will
    yield a similar configuration to that of the SpliceBert
    [biomed-AI/SpliceBERT](https://github.com/biomed-AI/SpliceBERT) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PreTrainedConfig`][multimolecule.models.PreTrainedConfig] and can be used to
    control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [`PreTrainedConfig`][multimolecule.models.PreTrainedConfig]
    for more information.

    Args:
        vocab_size:
            Vocabulary size of the SpliceBert model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by
            the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`SpliceBertModel`].
        hidden_size:
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
        num_hidden_layers:
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        num_attention_heads:
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer encoder.
        intermediate_size:
            Dimensionality of the "intermediate" (often named feed-forward) layer in the Transformer encoder.
        hidden_dropout:
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_dropout:
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings:
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        initializer_range:
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        layer_norm_eps:
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.

    Examples:
        >>> from multimolecule import SpliceBertModel, SpliceBertConfig
        >>> # Initializing a SpliceBERT multimolecule/splicebert style configuration
        >>> configuration = SpliceBertConfig()
        >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the multimolecule/splicebert style configuration
        >>> model = SpliceBertModel(configuration)
        >>> # Accessing the model configuration
        >>> configuration = model.config
