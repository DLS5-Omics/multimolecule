class UtrLmConfig(PreTrainedConfig):
    r"""
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`UtrLmModel`][multimolecule.models.UtrLmModel].
    It is used to instantiate a UTR-LM model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the UTR-LM
    [a96123155/UTR-LM](https://github.com/a96123155/UTR-LM) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PreTrainedConfig`][multimolecule.models.PreTrainedConfig] and can be used to
    control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [`PreTrainedConfig`][multimolecule.models.PreTrainedConfig]
    for more information.

    Args:
        vocab_size:
            Vocabulary size of the UTR-LM model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`UtrLmModel`].
        hidden_size:
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
        num_hidden_layers:
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        num_attention_heads:
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer encoder.
        intermediate_size:
            Dimensionality of the "intermediate" (often named feed-forward) layer in the Transformer encoder.
        hidden_act:
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the encoder and pooler. If string, `"gelu"`,
            `"relu"`, `"silu"` and `"gelu_new"` are supported.
        hidden_dropout:
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_dropout:
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings:
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        initializer_range:
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        layer_norm_eps:
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.
        position_embedding_type:
            Type of position embedding. Choose one of `"absolute"`, `"relative_key"`, `"relative_key_query"`,
            `"rotary"`.
            For positional embeddings use `"absolute"`. For more information on `"relative_key"`, please refer to
            [Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations (Shaw et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02155).
            For more information on `"relative_key_query"`, please refer to *Method 4* in [Improve Transformer Models
            with Better Relative Position Embeddings (Huang et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13658).
        is_decoder:
            Whether the model is used as a decoder or not. If `False`, the model is used as an encoder.
        use_cache:
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models). Only
            relevant if `config.is_decoder=True`.
        emb_layer_norm_before:
            Whether to apply layer normalization after embeddings but before the main stem of the network.
        token_dropout:
            When this is enabled, masked tokens are treated as if they had been dropped out by input dropout.
        head:
            The configuration of the head.
        lm_head:
            The configuration of the masked language model head.

    Examples:
        >>> from multimolecule import UtrLmConfig, UtrLmModel
        >>> # Initializing a UTR-LM multimolecule/utrlm style configuration
        >>> configuration = UtrLmConfig()
        >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the multimolecule/utrlm style configuration
        >>> model = UtrLmModel(configuration)
        >>> # Accessing the model configuration
        >>> configuration = model.config
