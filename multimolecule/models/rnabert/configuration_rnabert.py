class RnaBertConfig(PreTrainedConfig):
    r"""
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`RnaBertModel`][multimolecule.models.RnaBertModel].
    It is used to instantiate a RnaBert model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RnaBert
    [mana438/RNABERT](https://github.com/mana438/RNABERT) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PreTrainedConfig`][multimolecule.models.PreTrainedConfig] and can be used to
    control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [`PreTrainedConfig`][multimolecule.models.PreTrainedConfig]
    for more information.

    Args:
        vocab_size:
            Vocabulary size of the RnaBert model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`RnaBertModel`].
        hidden_size:
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
        num_hidden_layers:
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        num_attention_heads:
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer encoder.
        intermediate_size:
            Dimensionality of the "intermediate" (often named feed-forward) layer in the Transformer encoder.
        hidden_dropout:
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_dropout:
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings:
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        initializer_range:
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        layer_norm_eps:
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.

    Examples:
        >>> from multimolecule import RnaBertModel, RnaBertConfig
        >>> # Initializing a RNABERT multimolecule/rnabert style configuration
        >>> configuration = RnaBertConfig()
        >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the multimolecule/rnabert style configuration
        >>> model = RnaBertModel(configuration)
        >>> # Accessing the model configuration
        >>> configuration = model.config
